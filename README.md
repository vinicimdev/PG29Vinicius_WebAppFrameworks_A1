# PG29Vinicius_WebAppFrameworks_A1

## Overview

I used the base project made in class for the frontend and backend with Vue. For this assignment, I implemented the two new screens, for Contact and for the Leaderboard. For the two additional components, I added a Settings component for the table, that lets you sort the table by name, by score, or refresh the table (in case the data from the backend gets updated in the future).

I increased the size of the table on the backend manually, added each player for each person on the PG29 class, and generated their score randomly. For the Leaderboard Summary, I'm only displaying the first 3 players of the leaderboard, but for the table on the Leaderboard screen I'm displaying the whole leaderboard.

## How to run the code

Open both the frontend and the backend folder on CMD and execute 'npm run dev'. 
After that, open the link generated by the frontend command prompt.
